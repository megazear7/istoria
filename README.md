Use `create-cards.js`. Still working through converting to photofoundry.
Once fully converted and all cards can be created with photofoundry, then update to older version of game
Then, figure out how to add images from ai
Then, create images for every card and upload them somewhere to get printed

# TODO
 - Add `scout` element
 - Fix symbols to all be white like the originals
 - Update card rules based on the cards I have printed
 - Change back to 1 wealth rules without the market mechanic
